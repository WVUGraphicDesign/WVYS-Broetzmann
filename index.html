    <h3 class="homeh3">The Official Youth Symphony Of West Virginia</h3>

    <p class="headerp">The West Virginia Youth Symphony is a non-profit youth arts <br> organization that supports four music ensembles that meet <br> for rehearsal weekly and perform regularly throughout an <br> academic year program.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
<img src="images/kaelbloom.png" alt="Cadet Strings Ensemble" class="cadetstringshome">
<p class="homesectiononep">Currently, 126 students from 11 West <br> Virginia counties, and 36 different <br> schools are enrolled in the program. <br> Of those students, approximately <br> 40 students participate in an optional <br> chamber ensemble program learning <br> unique repertoire for smaller <br> ensemble learning and performing.</p>

<p class="homesectiononep">Professional musicians from the West <br> Virginia Symphony Orchestra and <br> community are the conductors and <br> coaches for the program. Master classes, <br> field trips, run-out concerts and other <br> special events may be included as <br> funding permits. It is a fun and social <br> musical learning adventure ~ with <br> some of the most talented students <br> and musicians from across the region <br> participating! Students are presented <br> challenging music to encourage musical <br> growth and to provide a stimulating <br> learning experience.</p>

<p class="homesectiononecontact">We invite you to contact the Youth Symphony <br> offices at 304-957-9888 to schedule a <br> new student audition today!</p>

<h2 class="homeh2a">Our History</h2>

<img src="images/sigmund.png" alt="History Photo" class="historyphoto">

<p class="homesectiontwop">The West Virginia Youth Symphony <br> originated in 1949 when the Charleston <br> Woman's Club organized the Kanawha <br> Valley Youth Orchestra. It has operated <br> continuously since then, becoming <br> incorporated in 1968 as the Charleston <br> Symphony Youth Orchestra and changing <br> its name in 1991 to the West Virginia Youth <br> Symphony. While the name has changed, <br> the goal has remained the same - to <br> provide opportunities for young people <br> to perform in an orchestra setting.
<br><br>
Each year, about 125 young musicians <br> participate, making it both the largest <br> and the oldest youth orchestra in the <br> state. Students come from as far away <br> as Ohio to rehearse weekly in Charleston. <br> Ages range from 7 to 20, and students <br> from 36 public and private schools, plus <br> college and home-school, are making <br> music together each week.</p>

<h2 class="homeh2b">Information About Our Program</h2>

<img src="images/spring2015-7.png" alt="Girl with Stringed Instrument" class="spring20157">

<p class="programinforight">The Youth Symphony has two <br> all-strings groups, the Cadet Strings <br> and the older Youth Strings, and the <br> Youth Orchestra which includes our <br> most advanced strings players joined <br> by winds, brass and percussion. In <br> addition, our wind, brass and percussion <br> play in their own Wind Ensemble, and we <br> have a Youth Winds group to advance <br> the skills of younger wind players.</p>

<p class="programinforight">These groups perform at two main <br> concerts each year, as well as on the <br> main stage at Symphony Sunday. Each <br> year the musicians have the chance to <br> form a number of chamber groups with <br> individual instruction, and these are <br> presented in a Chamber Concert in late <br> winter. These chamber groups also play <br> at a number of different public events, <br> such as Charleston's Good Night and <br> Art Walk.</p>

<p class="programinforight">All West Virginia Youth Symphony <br> conductors and coaches are professional <br> musicians with the West Virginia Symphony. <br> As a result, the Youth Symphony aids the <br> area economy by providing professional <br> musicians with additional work, and the <br> area culture by helping to keep these <br> musicians in the region.</p>

<p class="programinfoleft">In the twin interests of furthering the <br> musical education of the students, <br> and taking West Virginia to other <br> countries, the West Virginia Youth <br> Symphony has organized three <br> European Performance Tours. In 2000, <br> 40 WVYS musicians traveled to Prague, <br> Vienna, Brno and Budapest, performing <br> in several locations and learning <br> first-hand about the music they play.</p>

<p class="programinfoleft">In 2006, more WVYS musicians <br> traveled to Italy and Austria, visiting <br> Florence, Venice and Salzburg, and <br> performing in venues including a <br> monastery and the Reichenhall town <br> hall. At one location, the WVYS members <br> met and dined with a group of Italian <br> high school musicians, who then opened <br> the concert for the West Virginia Youth <br> Symphony. In 2012 a ten-day, <br> three-performance European Tour to <br> Hungary, Slovakia and Austria featured a <br> visit to Charleston's sister city, Banska <br> Bystrica in the heart of Slovakia, and <br> a joint performance with the Conservatory <br> of Music there. Many of the students <br> had the opportunity to stay in the <br> homes of Slovakian families.  The <br> WVYS traveled again in 2017 to <br> Eastern European for another <br> successful three-concert tour.</p>

<p class="programinfoleft">One of our requirements is that all <br> students take music classes in their <br> schools when available. Not only are <br> WVYS members some of the best <br> student musicians in the region, they <br> are also among the highest-ranking <br> students in the area, many taking AP <br> and Honors classes as they prepare <br> for college. The West Virginia Youth <br> Symphony represents the best and <br> brightest of West Virginia and has <br> recently been designated by <br> the WV Legislature as the Official Youth <br> Symphony of West Virginia.</p>
